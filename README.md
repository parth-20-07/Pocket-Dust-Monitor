# Pocket Air Quality Index Monitor

## Why AQI Monitor is needed?
Carry Air Pocket Monitor before stepping out of your house in order to know the quality of the air you’re breathing. The pocket-sized air monitoring device is handy and easy to carry around.

It helps you understand the level of Particulate Matter 2.5 of your location. Works as both – real-time indoor and outdoor air quality monitoring sensor; the LCD display shows you PM reading indicating if the air is safe or not.

Having a desktop friendly version helps to determine the quality of air which can help you improving your life and work quality.

## Features of our AQI Monitor
- Shows the value of PM2.5 along with the safety level.
- Shows simultaneous value of PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10.
- Plots the graph of PM2.5 on a graph in difference of 5 minutes.
- Approx. 1.5 hours Battery Backup.
- Type C charging support.
